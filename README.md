For my projects general theme I will be doing a menu for my parents coffee shop where it's interactive such as having new coffees (Seasonal coffees) be uploadable by the owners / staff where they're able to remove and add new coffees (Kind of like how we used the API to make a table that we added to and then removed from and also clearing it. I want it to be interactive such as an administrator panel and then the index launch page for the users who go to see the menu. Storing the data I will be using AWS and have the web pages be covered with a sample picture of the coffee, the price, the name and then possibly what time it goes best with? I don't drink coffee personally but hopefully that's a thing. The target audience is going to be the administrators (The staff of the shop) as well as the general public to be viewing and leaving comments on which drinks were their personal favorites. I might also try linking their reviews as it's at a 5 star and I feel like that will drive more customers to come to the shop.

 

Data that will be managed through the website is going to be their reviews and the prices changing / drinks being removed and added.

 

Stretch goals that I would like to implement would be having it fully functional by the end of the timeline and having the reviews uploaded automatically off of yelp (Not sure how this would work but I will figure it out throughout the project and try having it functional).
